title: MailChimp Redesign

summary:
  When the MailChimp marketing website was redesigned, I rebuilt the site from the ground up. The site moved from Expression Engine to a Ruby-based static site generator. The site receives over 200,000 page views each day, and the front-end is optimized to ensure great performance.
