title: UTC Art Department

summary:
  As a design student at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), I co-redesigned the Art Department website. As an engineer at Medium, I developed new Art Department site on a Python-based web framework. The site maintains a clean and minimal aesthetic. Courses, departments and faculty all have unique profiles.
