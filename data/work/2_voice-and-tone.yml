title: Voice and Tone

summary:
  Voice and Tone is MailChimp&rsquo;s internal guide to maintaining a consistent tone in writing. The site is built on Sintra, and it takes advantage of AJAX and HTML5 PushState to create a smooth browsing experience. I used CSS3 media queries to create a mobile phone optimized version of the site.
